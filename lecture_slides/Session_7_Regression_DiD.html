<ul>
<li>Today we’re going to look at one of the most commonly used methods
in causal inference, called <em>Difference-in-Differences</em>.</li>
<li>Before we get there, let’s look at something simpler. The
<em>Difference Estimator</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="difference-estimator" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Difference Estimator</h1>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, we observe people before and after a program.</li>
<li>A possible estimator of the impact of treatment is the change in the
outcome variable over time and is called the <em>Before-After
estimator</em> or the <em>Difference estimator</em>.</li>
<li>This is a widely popular estimator, not only among <em>professional
program evaluators</em>.</li>

<div id="the-basic-problem" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Basic Problem</h1>
<ul>
<li>The relationship between time and treatment is very clear: early =
no treatment. Late = treatment</li>
<li><em>If anything else is changing over time, we have a back
door!</em></li>
<li>We assume that without the treatment, the outcome would be
constant.</li>

<h1>The Basic Problem</h1>
<ul>
<li>Ok, time is a back door, no problem. We can observe and measure
time. So we’ll just control for it and close the back door!
<ul>
<li>But we can’t!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why not?
<ul>
<li>Because in this group, you’re either before treatment and
<code>T = 0</code>, or after treatment and <code>T = 1</code>. If we
control for time, we’re effectively controlling for treatment</li>

<li>Obtain an estimate of how the outcome would have changed for treated
units in the absence of the treatment. This is a missing counterfactual
trend.</li>
<li>An estimate of this missing counterfactual trend could be the actual
trend for some untreated group over this same time period.</li>

<li>And we have an untreated group</li>
<li>The treated and control groups probably aren’t identical - there are

<li>Age ≤ 50</li>
<li>Residence in a certain state</li>
<li>All products containing meat</li>

<h1>Identification with DiD: Common Trend Assumption</h1>
<ul>
<li>The key identifying assumption of the DiD estimator is that the
observed trend of the comparison group is the same as the counterfactual
trend of the treated group.
<ul>
<li>i.e. if the treatment had not occurred, the gap between treatment
and control would have stayed the same after treatment as it was before
treatment</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do we know this is true?
<ul>
<li>We don’t! It’s one of these untestable assumptions. We have to
select a control group where we can plausibly <em>assume</em> that the
trends are identical.</li>
<li>An indirect test is to look whether treatment and control group
followed parallel trends in the periods before the treatment.</li>

for certain goods on the demand for these goods.</p></li>
<li><p>Demand for these goods might increase in the pre-treatment period

<h1>Some practical considerations for DiD I</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Institutional setting</strong>: Be clear about the policy
change (policy changes often come in bundles).</li>
<li><strong>Endogenous policy</strong>: Maybe groups have lobbied for a
policy in expectation of certain trends in outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Spillovers</strong>: Choose a control group that reasonably
follows parallel trends but that is not affected by the treatment in any
way.</li>
<li><strong>Timing</strong>: Announcement might have an effect even
before the policy is officially in place (anticipation effect).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="some-practical-considerations-for-did-ii"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>Some practical considerations for DiD II</h1>
<ul>
<li>Discuss parallel trend assumptions: Show pre-treatment trends.</li>
<li>Compositional effects: Can the treatment change the composition of
the treated group, i.e., by encouraging people to move in or out of a
treated area?</li>
<li>Try a flexible DiD specification that allows you to trace out the
full adjustment path.</li>
<li>Estimating standard errors in DiD settings is often difficult. Most
common strategy is to cluster standard errors at the group level. See
also Section 8.2.2 in <em>Angrist and Pischke (2009)</em>.</li>

<h1>Application: Extending unemployment benefits and early

<ul>
<li><em>Inderbitzin, Staubli, and Zweimueller (2016)</em> study the
causal impact of extended UI benefits on:
<ul>
<li>The incidence of early retirement.</li>
<li>The particular pathways through which workers exit the labor
market.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In Austria, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, workers aged 50+ were
eligible for one year of regular UI benefits. Workers aged 55+ had
relaxed access to DI benefits.</li>
<li>For empirical identification, they exploit the regional extended
benefits program (REBP) that changed early retirement incentives
dramatically.</li>
<li>The program was in place between June 1988 and July 1993 and granted
UI benefits for up to 4 years to workers aged 50+ living in certain
regions of the country.</li>

pension at age 55 (early retirement with DI). Unemployed men can retire
early without DI at age 58 without the REBP and age 55 with the REBP by
claiming regular UI benefits followed by special income support at age
59 and an old-age pension at age 60 (early retirement without DI).
