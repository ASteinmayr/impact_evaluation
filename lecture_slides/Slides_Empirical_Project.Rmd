# Now it is your turn: Conduct your own project

- Students should design and implement their own empirical project.
- This includes all the steps we discuss in the lecture:
  - Develop a research question.
  - Develop a theory of change and a results chain.
  - Develop a causal diagram depicting the situation
  - Use one of the discussed strategies to identify the causal effect you are interested in.
  - Estimate the effects using Stata or R.
  - Present results in seminar and written paper.

---

# If you are totally overwhelmed...

- You can submit only the research design.
- You design a research project in the same way but you don't actually implement it.
- You do all steps outlined before except "Estimate the effects using Stata or R."
- **However: ** You can reach at most 70% of the maximum points reachable on the project! 

---

# Some Examples from Previous Years

- **Effect of vaccine-skeptic phyisicians ond vaccinations rates**
  - Control strategy (closing backdoors)
- **Effect of speed limit on highway accidents**
  - RDD using speed limits.
- **Effect of child care facilities on labor force participation of parents**
  - Difference-in-Differences using policy reforms in individual states

# Some Guidelines

- Work together in groups of two or three.
- You are free to choose and develop your own research project.
- You are free to use any data you want. I provide the SUF of the *Austrian Microcensus*. 
- Another source of Austrian data is *AUSSDA* https://aussda.at/ 
- For various datasets from all over the world look at https://tinyurl.com/2s4km8p3 
- If you donâ€™t have specific data in mind, I encourage you to use the Microcensus.
- Start thinking about potential research questions and research designs right away. Make notes about your ideas and discuss them with your colleagues.

---

# Initial Idea Submission

For your ideas, write down:

- Research question.
- Mechanisms / theory of change you have in mind.
- Setting and empirical strategy.
- Which data source you could use. Does it contain the necessary variables? Does it have a *sufficient* number of observations?

This should not be more than half a page. Send me a first email with your ideas no later than **December 11th**. Ideally, send individual ideas earlier.

---

# Feedback and Meetings

- I will provide feedback so you can select an idea for your project.
- We will have short virtual meetings during the week of **December 16th**.
- By **December 20th**, every group should have settled on a project with a clear strategy and start working on the implementation.
- We will have another short (virtual) meeting in the week of **January 6th**
- On the seminar day (**January 31st**), every group will present their project (50 minutes per project).
- Hand in the written project report no later than **February 5th**.

---

# Useful material and support

- Our book "The Effect" provides many practical examples and suggestions
- Look at research papers and how it's done there
- You can use ChatGPT (or other LLMs) if you are stuck in the coding process
  - **ALWAYS CHECK CODE THAT IS PRODUCED BY CHATGPT**
  - **DON'T USE CHATGPT TO PRODUCE CONTENT**
- Reach out to Elias Balayan if you are totally stuck.

# Presentation Content

Your presentation should cover the following points:

- Introduce your research question. Why is it interesting?
- The context in which you are trying to answer this question.
- The causal graph
- The method chosen to answer the questions.
- The data (variables, sample size) used.
- What the assumptions of the method mean in your context. Are these assumptions likely fulfilled?
  - Discuss using the causal graph
- Your findings.

---

# Research Report Structure

- The structure of the report can follow the structure of the presentation:
  - Introduction and research questions
  - Context
  - Causal graph
  - Data
  - Methods and discussion of assumptions
  - Results
  - Conclusion
- Length: 10-15 pages of text
- Provide sufficient information for replication of your analysis.

---

# Further Remarks

- Empirical research is hard. Most likely, not all assumptions required by the methods will be fulfilled in your setting.
- It's okay if some assumptions are violated. Discuss their implications.
- Finding no effect can be as interesting as finding a significant effect.
- Use the empirical papers discussed in class as a guide.

---

# Formal Guidelines for the Report

- Consider using LaTeX instead of MS Word for writing your report.
- You find a LaTeX template you can use on OLAT.
