Lecture : Front Door Identification and Treatment Effects
</h1>
</div>
</div>
<div id="recap" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Recap</h1>
<ul>
<li>We can represent our <em>causal model of the world</em> in a causal
diagram</li>
<li>Once we’ve written the model, it will tell us <em>exactly which
calculation</em> will identify our effect</li>
<li>We list all paths between treatment and outcome</li>
<li>Then, control for the right variables to close all back-door paths
while leaving all front-door paths open</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="but" class="slide section level2">
<h1>But!</h1>
<ul>
<li>There’s a big problem with this!</li>
<li>Simply, it’s <em>very common</em> that this approach will tell us
that we need to control for something that we can’t or didn’t
measure</li>
<li>It’s also common, since this is social science, to acknowledge that
there are probably a bunch of things we didn’t think of that
<em>should</em> be on our diagram, and so we shouldn’t be too confident
in our ability to close all the back doors</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="so-what-then" class="slide section level2">
<h1>So What Then?</h1>
<ul>
<li>In economics in particular, we will try to <em>isolate the variation
in a single front-door path</em> instead of shutting all the back-door
paths</li>
<li>This can be done in a few different ways, which we’ll talk about
today, and cover heavily through the rest of the course</li>
<li>Note that all of these will generally <em>combine</em> with
back-door closing in order to work</li>
<li>Experiments, Natural Experiments, and (rarely) the Front-Door
Method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="experiments" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Experiments</h1>
<p>What is a randomized experiment?</p>
<ul>
<li>The researcher has control over the treatment itself</li>
<li>They can choose to randomly give it to some people but not
others</li>
<li>When you do this, some of the variation in treatment has <em>no back
doors</em></li>
<li>Plus, we can <em>find</em> that variation by only using the data
from our experiment!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="experiments-1" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Experiments</h1>
<ul>
<li>We’ve been talking about identification, we can also refer to a
variable that is assigned completely at random as “exogenous”</li>
<li>Something that is caused by some other variable in the diagram (has
back doors) is <em>endogenous</em></li>
<li>The random assignment is <em>exogenous</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="random-experiments-and-causality" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Random experiments and causality</h1>
<ul>
<li>Annoyingly, most things we’d like to know the effect of have
back-door paths to most of the outcomes we’d like to know the effect
<em>on</em></li>
</ul>

</div>
<div id="random-experiments-and-causality-1"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>Random experiments and causality</h1>
<ul>
<li>The whole idea of running an experiment is to <em>add another source
of variation in the Treatment that has no back doors</em></li>
</ul>
<p>   </p>
<p><img src="Session_6_Frontdoor_Treatment_Effects_files/figure-slidy/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="960" /></p>
</div>
<div id="random-experiments-and-causality-2"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>Random experiments and causality</h1>
<ul>
<li>If the randomization is truly random, it can’t possibly be related
to anything on the back doors. It ONLY affects Treatment - nothing
else!</li>
<li>So AMONG the people who were randomized in/out of treatment, this is
what the diagram looks like. Easy identification!</li>
</ul>
<p>   </p>
<p><img src="Session_6_Frontdoor_Treatment_Effects_files/figure-slidy/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="960" /></p>
</div>
<div id="experiments-2" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Experiments</h1>
<ul>
<li>So with a randomized experiment, identifying our causal arrow of
interest is easy, because among the subjects in our experiment, there is
no back door</li>
<li>But of course this comes with its own costs!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="problems-with-experiments" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Problems with Experiments</h1>
<ul>
<li>Not always possible/ethical</li>
<li>Expensive when they are possible/ethical</li>
<li>The fact they’re expensive can lead us to reduce on sample size</li>
<li>Or use people who are convenient to experiment on rather than
representative of everyone (e.g. students)</li>
<li>People may act differently if they know they’re in an
experiment</li>
<li>An artificial intervention may not be the same as the natural
thing</li>
<li>People might act due to treatment <em>assignment</em> (placebo
effect)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="problems-with-experiments-1" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Problems with Experiments</h1>
<ul>
<li>This is not to say that experiments are bad by any means</li>
<li>But there are reasons we can’t solve every problem with
experiments</li>
<li>So if we still want to study causal effects, we may be in a
situation where an experiment is infeasible, or may be outclassed by a
<em>natural</em> experiment…</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="natural-experiments" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Natural Experiments</h1>
<ul>
<li>A <em>natural experiment</em> can take many forms, but the basic
idea is that something experiment-like occurs without the researcher’s
control</li>
<li>In other words, <em>there is a form of exogenous variation in the
wild</em></li>
<li>(or at least conditionally exogenous)</li>
<li>And we can use that exogenous variation to identify our effect of
interest</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="natural-experiments-1" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Natural Experiments</h1>
<ul>
<li>Let’s take a classic example of the Vietnam lottery draft (Angrist
and Krueger 1992)</li>
<li>During the Vietnam war, men were drafted into the US military based
on their birthdates. The birthdates of the year were put into random
order, and men were drafted in that order</li>
<li>Basically, randomly assigning you to military service!</li>
<li>Being assigned to the draft early gave you extra reason to go to
college so you could avoid it - they wanted to know how college affected
your earnings</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="natural-experiments-2" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Natural Experiments</h1>
<ul>
<li>Even though the researcher has no control over this process (and
would likely do it a little differently if they could)…</li>
<li>If we <em>isolate just the part of military service that is driven
by this exogenous variation</em>…</li>
<li>Then <em>that variation in military service is, also,
exogenous</em></li>
<li>Just like in an experiment we only use data from people in the
experiment</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="isolating-variation" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Isolating Variation</h1>
<ul>
<li>It’s sort of like the opposite of controlling: Instead of removing
the variation associated with a variable, we remove all variation
<em>not</em> associated with it</li>
<li>This is a way that we can mimic an actual controlled experiment
using only observational data</li>
<li>In many cases this is more plausible than controlling for enough
stuff because we have ideally <em>moved the assumptions we need to make
to an easier variable</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="moving-the-assumptions" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Moving the Assumptions</h1>
<ul>
<li>In effect, this <em>moves our assumptions</em> from one variable to
another</li>
<li>To identify the effect of treatment by controlling for stuff, we
must identify all back doors between <span
class="math inline">\(Treatment\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Outcome\)</span> and close them</li>
<li>Now, instead, we must identify all back doors between <span
class="math inline">\(ExogenousVariation\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Outcome\)</span> (or front doors that don’t pass
through <span class="math inline">\(Treatment\)</span>) and close all of
<em>them</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="moving-the-assumptions-1" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Moving the Assumptions</h1>
<ul>
<li>The same assumptions need to apply! But hopefully those assumptions
are <em>more plausible</em> for our source of exogenous variation than
our treatment</li>
<li>There are a BUNCH of back doors having to do with college
attendance. It would be really hard to close them all</li>
<li>But, while we can imagine some stories as to how birthdate might
have back doors, they’re likely more limited, and maybe we can believe
we can actually control for all of them</li>
<li>(like I said, sometimes exogeneity only holds conditionally - we may
need to control for something! Perhaps richer people are more likely to
have kids on certain days, so we’d want to control for parental
income)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="treatment-effects" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Treatment Effects</h1>
<ul>
<li>For any given treatment, there are likely to be <em>many</em>
treatment effects</li>
<li>Different individuals will respond to different degrees (or even
directions!)</li>
<li>This is called <em>heterogeneous treatment effects</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="treatment-effects-1" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Treatment Effects</h1>
<ul>
<li>When we identify a treatment effect, what we’re <em>estimating</em>
is some mixture of all those individual treatment effects</li>
<li>But what kind of mixture? Is it an average of all of them? An
average of some of them? A weighted average? Not an average at all?</li>
<li>What we get depends on <em>the research design itself</em> as well
as <em>the estimator we use to perform that design</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="individual-treatment-effects" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Individual Treatment Effects</h1>
<ul>
<li>While we can’t always estimate it directly, the true regression
model becomes something like</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_iX + \varepsilon
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span> follows its own
distribution across individuals</li>
<li>(and remember, this is theoretical - we’d still have those
individual <span class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span>s even with one
observation per individual and no way to estimate them separately)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="summarizing-effects" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Summarizing Effects</h1>
<ul>
<li>There are methods that try to give us the whole distribution of
effects (and we’ll talk about some of them next time)</li>
<li>But often we only get a single effect, <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_1\)</span>.</li>
<li>This <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_1\)</span> is some
summary statistic of the <span class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span>
distribution. But <em>what</em> summary statistic?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="summarizing-effects-1" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Summarizing Effects</h1>
<ul>
<li>Average treatment effect: the mean of <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span></li>
<li>Conditional average treatment effect (CATE): the mean of <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span> <em>conditional on some
value</em> (say, “just for men”, i.e. conditional on being a man)</li>
<li>Weighted average treatment effect (WTE): the weighted mean of <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span>, with weights <span
class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The latter two come in <em>many</em> flavors</p>
</div>
<div id="common-conditional-average-treatment-effects"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>Common Conditional Average Treatment Effects</h1>
<ul>
<li>The ATE among some demographic group</li>
<li>The ATE among some specific group (conditional average treatment
effect)</li>
<li>The ATE just among people who were actually treated (ATT)</li>
<li>The ATE just among people who were NOT actually treated (ATUT)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="comon-weighted-average-treatment-effects"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>Comon Weighted Average Treatment Effects</h1>
<ul>
<li>The ATE weighted by how responsive you are to an
instrument/treatment assignment (local average treatment effect)</li>
<li>The ATE weighted by how much variation in treatment you have after
all back doors are closed (variance-weighted)</li>
<li>The ATE weighted by how commonly-represented your mix of control
variables is (distribution-weighted)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="are-they-good" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Are They Good?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Which average you’d <em>want</em> depends on what you’d want to do
with it</li>
<li>Want to know how effective a treatment <em>was</em> when it was
applied? Average Treatment on Treated</li>
<li>Want to know how effective a treatment would be if applied to
everyone/at random? Average Treatment Effect</li>
<li>Want to know how effective a treatment would be if applied <em>just
a little more broadly?</em> <strong>Marginal Treatment Effect</strong>
(literally, the effect for the next person who would be treated), or,
sometimes, Local Average Treatment Effect</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="are-they-good-1" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Are They Good?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Different treatment effect averages aren’t <em>wrong</em> but we
need to pay attention to which one we’re getting, or else we may apply
the result incorrectly</li>
<li>We don’t want that!</li>
<li>A result could end up representing a different group than you’re
really interested in</li>
<li>There are technical ways of figuring out what average you get, and
also intuitive ways</li>
